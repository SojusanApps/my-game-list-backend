Application to manage game lists.

## Basic assumptions

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.14
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) >= 6.0
* REST API based on the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
* Line length 120
* Language: English
* Tests performed with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)
* Full compatibility with [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
* Assumed coverage in tests > 90%
* Automatic tests for PostgreSQL in GitHub CI
* Package management with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv)

## Assumptions about the release preparation and deployment methodology

1. I keep 2 branches:
   * **master**: The master branch of the repository contains the fully functional production code.
   * **devel**: The branch for development contains the functional code with new features.
1. I use versioning following the [semver 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
1. The `master` and `devel` branches should contain stable and working code.
1. Workflow:
    * The developer is preparing a branch with new functionality or a correction, giving it a name as *[bugfix/feature/hotfix]/[description]*, e.g. *feature/new-document*
    * When the code is ready, the developer prepares PR (Pull Request) for the **devel** branch for new functionalities
    * If all functionalities work, the code is uploaded to the **master** branch

Tag Legend:

* **latest** - The latest production version.

## Deploy

1. Create the file `docker-compose.yaml` and upload it to the production server. (only the first time)
1. Log in via ssh to the production server and execute the following commands:

   ```shell
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml pull
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --detach --force-recreate --remove-orphans
   ```

## Local installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub with the command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/SojusanApps/my-game-list-backend.git
   ```

1. Install all project dependencies:

   ```shell
   uv sync --all-extras
   ```

1. Install the `pre-commit` hooks:

   ```shell
   uv run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
   ```

   To disable checking of certain hooks, you can use the `SKIP` variable, e.g.:

   ```shell
   SKIP=check-version-and-changelog git push
   ```

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database in docker:

   ```shell
   docker run --name my-game-list-postgres \
      -p 5432:5432 \
      -e POSTGRES_DB=my_game_list \
      -e POSTGRES_USER=my_game_list \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_game_list \
      -v my-game-list-postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql \
      -d postgres:18.0-alpine
   ```

1. Run database migrations:

   ```shell
   uv run scripts/my-game-list-manage.py migrate
   ```

1. Create a Django admin account:

   ```shell
   uv run scripts/my-game-list-manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

1.Start the development server:

   ```shell
   uv run scripts/my-game-list-manage.py runserver
   ```

## Configuration

* All configurations can be found in `my_game_list/settings/`
* **base.py** - contains the base configuration of the application
* **devel.py** - includes development configuration
* **test.py** - contains configuration for tests
* You can set up any configuration file using the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable

## Swagger

Swagger enables you to visualize and interact with a RESTful API. It generates automatically based on the OpenAPI specification, a list of available endings along with the documentation contained in the code. In addition, it presents examples of data structures that should be sent to a given end and enables direct interaction with them.

Swagger is available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/my-game-list/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/my-game-list/)

## Tests

1. Running tests using the PostgreSQL database:

   ```shell
   uv run scripts/my-game-list-run-tests-with-pg.sh
   ```

2. Starting the full test stack with the tox utility:

   ```shell
   uv run tox
   ```
